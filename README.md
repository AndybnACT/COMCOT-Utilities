# COMCOT-Utilities
This is a repository that contains useful tools to work with COMCOT, a Tsunami modeling program.
Descriptions of the content are shown below.
# ARRIVAL-TIME
This is a patch of COMCOT v1.7 making the program generate arrival time data by itself. The program will record the arrival time with the highest level of time resolution (use origin time-step), which eliminate the 'shading' effect generated by post-processing method because of the lack of time resolution, for each layer. Additionaly, compare to post-processing method, the upgraded program will be far faster for processing arrival time because it obtain arrival time data from RAM but not HDD.
# AT-SHELL
A BASH script that makes system fork a 'at shell' to keep the process of simulation alive whether the user is still connected to the cluster 'wave' after the process has been started by the script.
# XYZ-VIEWER
C programs that read xyz files and show properties of them.
